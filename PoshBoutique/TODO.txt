Validate state during authentication
move external-login-authenticated.html to state in the app
handle unauthenticated response code (except load data requests) and expired tokens with separate login state + return url
respect the ".expires" value returned by the /token endpoint and remove the token after that date
handle expired tokens in smarter way
